# Overview

As a software engineer eager to advance my skills, I took on a challenging Rust project using Visual Studio Code. I used a lot of the resources listed below to learn the language and The software I developed showcases a simple web scrapper that pulls some books from a sample website and produces the books name and price. This aimed to push the boundaries of my understanding of Rust's syntax, features, and best practices.

# Development Environment

The software was crafted using Visual Studio Code as the primary integrated development environment (IDE). The development tools include:

- IDE: Visual Studio Code
- Version Control: Github
- Dependencies and Libraries: scraper, reqwest, tokio

# Useful Websites

Throughout the challenging development process, the following websites proved invaluable:

- [Rust Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/)
- [Rust Programming Language Forum](https://users.rust-lang.org/)
- [Official Rust GitHub Repository](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust)
- [Rust tutorials](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/rust/rust_environment_setup.htm)

# Future Work

Future work on this project includes:

- Get descriptions and post data to a an exterior txt file
- Implement additional classes to modularize the code more with reusable parts
- Add capacity to scrape other websites from user input and to look for what the user wants using SEO details
